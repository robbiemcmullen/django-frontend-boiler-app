# Realbuzz Frontend App

---

####App details
This front-end app template provides you with a lightweight setup for getting started with your front-end project. Spend less time setting up gulp, dir structure, basic files and write some real code instead!

The app is designed with minimal code. Again, front-end devs have their own preference setting up a directory structure and so on, but I've developed this keeping best practices in mind.

---

####Why use this setup?
Realbuzz project was rushed into version 5 and used a lot of front end developers that worked in their own way. The the project became a mess!! It was hard to know where to place code!! This was developed to keep in mind high standards, good housekeeping and how we should structure our apps
